## Dataset For Cognitive Science

### 1. FrcSub
FrcSub is a public dataset for measuring student's skills proficiency on the examinee.
The file comprimise of item response log and knowledge point matrix labeled by professional experts.

The knowledge point matrix examinee the following 8 skills:
* 1	Convert a whole number to a fraction,

* 2	Separate a whole number from a fraction,

* 3	Simplify before subtracting,

* 4	Find a common denominator,

* 5	Borrow from whole number part,

* 6	Column borrow to subtract the second numerator from the first,

* 7	Subtract numerators,

* 8	Reduce answers to simplest form.

Each item-skills record was stored in the Q.txt file.

### 2. Math1
The data structure is the same to the public FrcSub. The knowledge point matrix examinee the following 11 skills:

* 1	Set,
* 2	Inequality,
* 3	Trigonometric function,
* 4	Logarithm versus exponential,
* 5	Plane vector,
* 6	Property of function,
* 7	Image of function,
* 8	Spatial imagination,
* 9	Abstract summarization,
* 10	Reasoning and demonstration,
* 11	Calculation.
